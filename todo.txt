Current Codebase Problems:
The gripping system is a monolith. I want to make it easy to add, remove, or modify a variety of grip locking types.
No facility for communication between item scripts.
Reading Metadata is too ugly
ItemInstance system sucks. (<- Elaborate)
Need MUCH more possible information for items.

BaseItem functionality is vauge and unhelpful.
CollisionMasks are not obvious, no helpful info...
Item Ownership still sucks

Things I want to add:
	Thumb Joint Control
	Reflection of effects and shit.
	ECS for items? (Fully represent items as data, and just have system implementations)
	Synchronization for guns and magazines (chamber state, round count)
	Proper Hitreg.
	Items able to communicate data.
	At least a basic nonintrusive anticheat.
	More robust IK & fullbody IK.
	3d Math Utility Module(s)
	Allow the 2-point directional grip system.
	Attachment (support) system for guns.
	Inventory system (?)
	Gesture system?
	VRClient class?
	VRInteraction System:
		Currently all we have is Hand-> Objects

Things I want to remove:

Questions:
	Keep _G.using semantic? Allow passing table?
	Weird mixture of OO and procedural? Lean more toward OO perhaps?
	Use Humanoid at all? (Don't like it that much!)
